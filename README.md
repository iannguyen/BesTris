The best Tetris game you'll play.

### How To play

...Really?

### Game Features

- COMPLETELY random Terminos. Choose your moves carefully. `LinePieces` may not be there to save you.

- `WallKick` enables you to rotate your pieces even if they are against a wall.

- Points are rewarded for every Termino you place, every line cleared, and bonus points per additional line cleared.

JUST PLAY IT!

### Todo

- Allow moves to be chained together for additional points.
- Add `next piece` canvas.
- Add difficulty presets from the start.
